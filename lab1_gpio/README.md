# Lab 1 - GPIO Driver (No RTOS)

In this lab you will:

1. Install the IDE (Code Composer Studio).
2. Write a GPIO driver from scratch using the reference material - TI
   DriverLib is not allowed.
3. Demonstrate control over an RGB LED based on user input.

This document is the complete assignment: what to build, how it's
graded, and how to get started.

## Overview

You will build a minimal GPIO driver for the MSPM0G3507 **directly against
its registers** - no TI DriverLib, no SysConfig-generated pin init - and
use it to read two push-buttons and drive an RGB LED. This is the
foundational bare-metal skill for the rest of the course: given a
datasheet and a Technical Reference Manual (TRM), you should be able to
find the memory-mapped registers that control a peripheral and drive them
correctly yourself, without depending on a vendor abstraction layer.

## Learning Objectives

- Import and build a Code Composer Studio (Theia) "nortos" project
  targeting the LP-MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad, and flash it over the on-board
  XDS110 debug probe.
- Read the MSPM0G350x TRM well enough to locate the GPIO and IOMUX
  register maps for a specific pin.
- Implement a concrete class against an instructor-provided abstract
  interface (pure virtual functions), using direct memory-mapped
  register access.
- Apply this repo's register-access conventions (`style.md` §S.10,
  Memory-Mapped I/O) to real hardware.

## Hardware

Board: [LP-MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0G3507).

The on-board RGB LED (LED2) is wired to GPIO port B:

| Color | Pin  |
| ----- | ---- |
| Red   | PB26 |
| Green | PB27 |
| Blue  | PB22 |

The two push-buttons (S1, S2) are also wired to GPIO pins, but you'll need
to find exactly which ones yourself from the
[LP-MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad (Dev Board) User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873)
(TI literature number SLAU873).

## Grading Rubric (50 pt)

1. **Toolchain setup - 10 pts.** Install CCS along with the **MSPM0-SDK**
   (2.10.00.04) and **SysConfig** products - these are what let CCS
   resolve this project's `${COM_TI_MSPM0_SDK_*}` build variables. Then
   import the `cmpe146-2026-MSPM0G3507` repo as a new workspace folder,
   build this project, and flash/debug it as-is. Minimum required work
   for points: the application prints `"Hello, World"` - the starter
   code already does this via `SYSCFG_DL_init()` and `std::printf`.
1. **Implement `output_pin` driver for MSPM0G3507 - 10 pts** - Write a concrete
   class that implements the `output_pin` interface.
1. **Implement `input_pin` driver for MSPM0G3507 - 10 pts** - Write a concrete
   class that implements the `input_pin` interface.
1. **Switch Sense & LED Control demonstration - 10 pts.** Using your gpio
   drivers:
   - Pressing S1 turns the RGB LED to a color (any color).
   - Pressing S2 turns the RGB LED to a different color than S1.
   - Pressing both switches turns the RGB to a 3rd color.
   - The instructor will request that one of the colors be changed
     during the demo and you are responsible for demonstrate that you can
     changing the color, rebuild, and reflash, and demonstrate that the new
     color is working.
1. **Code review - 10 pts.** Submit a PR to your git repo targeting your
   `main` branch.

## Reference material

- **[MSPM0G350x Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau846e/slau846e.pdf)** -
  General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) chapter and Input/Output
  Multiplexer (IOMUX) chapter. This is where the register offsets and
  bit fields you need actually live.
- **[MSPM0G3507 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/mspm0g3507.pdf)** -
  pin-to-peripheral function table, and the GPIO/IOMUX electrical
  characteristics.
- **[LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873)** -
  on-board LED/button wiring and BoosterPack pinout.
- **`style.md` §S.10 (Memory-Mapped I/O)** - the pattern this codebase
  uses for declaring and accessing hardware registers safely
  (`volatile` register-map structs, `reinterpret_cast` from a named
  `constexpr` base address, scoped to an anonymous namespace).

## HINT: IOMUX

The IOMUX value for GPIO is `1`. Its only stated in one area in the datasheet
in section `6.4 Connections for Unused Pins` that the IOMUX value for the GPIO
is value `1`. The section with the IOMUX information only has values 2 and
higher. Sometimes this happens with datasheets where information is either
missing or in a strange place thats hard to find.
