# cmpe146-2026-MSPM0G3507

Repo containing the labs for CmpE 146 2026 by Khalil Estell.

## Getting your workspace set up

This repo holds a Code Composer Studio (Theia) project per lab. It ships its
own workspace file, `cmpe146_mspm0g3507.theia-workspace`, scoped to just this
repo's folder:

1. Install CCS along with the **MSPM0-SDK** (2.10.00.04) and **SysConfig**
   products - these are what let CCS resolve this repo's
   `${COM_TI_MSPM0_SDK_*}` build variables.
2. Open CCS Theia and use **File > Open Workspace...** (or the equivalent in
   the Explorer overflow menu) to open `cmpe146_mspm0g3507.theia-workspace`
   from the folder you cloned this repo into.

> [!NOTE] 
> CCS Theia only allows one project of a given name per open workspace. Every
> lab in this repo is named `labN_*` to match the same lab in the sibling
> [cmpe146-2026-MSP-EXP432P401R](https://github.com/kammce/cmpe146-2026-MSP-EXP432P401R)
> repo, so if you add this repo's folder into a workspace that already has that
> repo's folder in it (e.g. via "Add Folder to Workspace" on a parent
> directory), CCS will refuse to load whichever lab loads second because the
> name collides. Opening this repo's own `.theia-workspace` file instead avoids
> that entirely, since it scopes the session to only this repo's projects. Note
> that CCS Theia only supports one open workspace at a time - switch workspace
> files when you move between this repo and the MSP-EXP432P401R one.

Each `labN_*/` folder is a self-contained CCS project:

- `.project` / `.cproject` / `.ccsproject` / `.settings/` - CCS project
  metadata, generated/maintained by CCS, don't hand-edit.
- `targetConfigs/` - debug probe + device configuration.
- `labN_*.syscfg` - SysConfig: clock tree and debug pins only. The
  peripheral that lab is teaching is deliberately left unconfigured here -
  you write that driver by hand.
- `labN_*.cpp` - where you write your driver classes and the lab's
  `main()`, against the shared interfaces in `../hal/`.
- `README.md` - that lab's assignment and grading rubric.
